ragur
=====

A virtual RAM machine (the successor model) 
programmed in C, it's just something for me
to do; to increase my fluency in C.

Anal.pl - analyzes input code and does
		some basic macro work.
Ragur.c - the machine itself, interprets
		ascii text.

Ragur is a word in old norwegian, meaning
a feminine man which was a great insult in the
old days, were masculinity was the thing that
kept the olde warriors going.
